Objective: Use past avocado data such as price, type (conventional/organic), size, location, climate to predict (Machine Learning)...

        - Price in specific regions
        - Whether avocado's are overpriced / underpriced, which season?
        - How each region fares in each season?
        - What does climate change have to do with avocado prices
        - Organic vs Conventional, in season vs out of season
        - Most expensive avocados vs Least expensive avocados
